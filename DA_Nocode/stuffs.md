Classification is a supervised machine learning technique in which, the target output is also provided along with the input data.

The target ouput data is *discrete* in nature.

There are two types of classification: Binomial Classification (2 target classes) and Multi-class classification (more than 2 target classes).

Regression is also a type of supervised learning technique.

The target output or the dependent variable is continuous in nature.

Logistic Regression uses the same basic formula as linear regression but it is regressing for the probability of a categorical outcome.

Linear regression gives a continuos value of output y for a given input X,.
Logistic regression gives a continous value output y for a given input X.

The reason: Logistic has "Regression" in it but using sigmoid function to generalize input data to give results as classification algorithm does.
